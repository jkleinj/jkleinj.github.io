Having finished the Deep Learning Specialisation in Coursera (deeplearning.ai),
I can thoroughly recommend the course. It is composed of 5 modules that take
the learner by the hand and introduce the concepts step-by-step without
shying away from the technical details and algebraic foundations of the algorithms.
The material is presented in lecture videos by Andrew Ng and complemented by interviews
with leading figures in the AI field. 
Additionally, graded quizzes and coding exercises in Python reinforce the learned material.
The more advanced models utilise common Neural Network libraries such as Tensorflow and Keras.
The specialisation requires a fair amount of time and some exprience in coding,
in particular basic knowledge of array and matrix operations in Python.
The course comes with a monthly fee, slower learning than the indended teaching plan is
allowed, submission deadlines can be adjusted as you go. Each completed module comes with
a certificate and completion of the 5 modules comes with an additional certificate.
At the end the learner has gained an overview of the state-of-the-art in Neural Networks,
which currently gain so much momentum in science and everyday life.
