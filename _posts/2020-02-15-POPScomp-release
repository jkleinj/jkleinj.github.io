We have re-worked the original programs/servers POPS and POPSCOMP.
The new program POPScomp unifies the two methods.
The code base hase been released at [GitHub POPScomp](https://github.com/Fraternalilab/POPScomp).
The [POPScomp server](http://popscomp.org:3838) is available as virtual instance on the Google Cloud.

The underlying POPS program has been run over the entire PDB (PDBML) database for the FunPDBe project.
The employed Makefile pipeline has been released together with the POPScomp code for completeness.

Alongside the server and GitHub repository, users can download the POPScomp Docker image,
which allows to run the program locally on a Shiny App without the need for any software installation.

Happy POPSing!
